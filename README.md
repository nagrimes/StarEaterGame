# Star Eater

============

Star Eater is a game made by myself and three other classmates. It's similar to agar.io, but with a space theme and instead of player driven enemies, the system uses AI to control enemy objects.

My job revolved around producer responsibilities, lead programmer responsibilities, mechanic design, and polish.

I suggested that we use a finite state machine to handle the behavior for enemy AI.

### Additional mechanics designed:
* Speed Boost
* Resize by player consuming enemy and vice versa
* Size displaying star size category
